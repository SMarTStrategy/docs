Mainly because it addresses a lot of questions about web API design, but also for its ease of use.\nThis simplicity, however, comes with a cost that is generally felt when you need to get out of the box.</p>\n<p>Fact is that at Les-Tilleuls.coop we also enjoy working on applications <strong>with strong business constraints</strong>, and even more to get off the rails. And when appropriate, we do so based on the DDD principles.</p>\n<p>Hexagonal message-oriented architecture, business logic decoupled from the infrastructure, â€¦ So many precepts that become prerequisites when it comes to putting the business at the center of our applications while ensuring <strong>their good maintainability</strong>.</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-mathias-arlaud -robin-chalas","track":"EN","start":"10:00","end":"10:40","date":"2022-09-15","short":"How to apply DDD principles to our favourite framework without losing its interest","title":"Domain-driven design with API Platform 3","edition":2022}},"staticQueryHashes":["2760183193","3395815452"]}
