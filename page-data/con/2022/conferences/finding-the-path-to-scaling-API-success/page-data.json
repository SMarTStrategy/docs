Should you <strong>add your new resource to an existing API</strong>, or should you <strong>create them in a new API</strong>?</p>\n<p>Any company discovering the value of building APIs is going to be faced with these questions at some point.  How should you partition your APIs? Should those partitions be exposed to customers, or should you <strong>federate those APIs</strong> behind a single fa√ßade? What does this mean for your <strong>API documentation</strong>? Your <strong>SDKs</strong>?</p>\n<p>Let me guide you on this journey to discover why some companies are making choices based on past experiences that do not translate well to distributed HTTP APIs.  Let me show you how to <strong>leverage one of the most underused aspect of HTTP APIs</strong> to build developer experiences that can scale to <strong>APIs of any size</strong>.</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-darrel-miller","track":"EN","start":"14:00","end":"14:40","date":"2022-09-16","short":"Come and learn how to leverage HTTP to let your API developer experiences scale.","title":"Finding the path to scaling API success","edition":2022}},"staticQueryHashes":["2760183193","3395815452"]}
