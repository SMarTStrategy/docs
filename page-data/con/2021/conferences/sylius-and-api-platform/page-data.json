A lot of people voluntarily committed the time to make impressive, multipurpose solutions. One of these solutions is the API Platform, the most mature framework for API development.</p>\n<p>In Sylius, <strong>it was always our goal to take advantage of the best of the breed and integrate with others</strong>. Keeping this in mind, we have decided to combine both projects and deliver <strong>a new quality in the headless e-commerce world</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>How did it go to integrate new infrastructure</strong> to the existing, pretty big codebase? <strong>What were the main challenges that we encountered</strong>, and how did we solve them? <strong>What are the key take-outs from our integrations</strong>? I will answer these and a few more questions during my talk.</p>","type":"conference","speakers":"-lukasz","track":"EN","start":"14:00","end":"14:40","date":"2021-09-10","short":"All you want to know about the integration of sylius and API Platform.","title":"Sylius and API Platform.
